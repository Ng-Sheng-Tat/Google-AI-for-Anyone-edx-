**What is AI?**

**Peak of Inflated Expectations**
- understanding of its doubts, capabilities or characterized by fear
- At this peak, the conversations around the technology are generally driven by ignorance, fear about what it might supplant, or doubt about its capabilities.

**Trough of Disillusionment**
- Start to understand the fundamentals to unleash all its capabilities and potentials, so that the technology can prosper
- As you understand what the technology does, you break out of the hype and may fall into the trough of disillusionment.

**Definition**

AI is a *technique of programming* a computer to respond to data in the same way an *intelligent being* does. It can be thought of as a simulation of how an intelligent being reacts to, processes, and understands the data.

Instead of hard rules being given, a variety of examples and its consequences are given to the computer to train the *models*. Analogous to learning from examples. 

*Answers* and *Data* are feed into *Machine Learning model* and the output is *Rules*.

**Understanding Data**
- feeding a lot of data as examples to the machine with definite *features*

- An AI system is typically *trained* by feeding it lots of data and enabling it to figure out patterns in the data. A trained model can then use these rules to solve problems using data it has not seen before!

- *Overfitting* means the models are feed with a lot of examples but lack of variety of examples, but the class is not general enough to classify other categories of things correctly. Keep feeding ordinary sport shoes but do not recognized unfeed high heel shoes. You introduced *bias*, a negative stereotype into your machine learning model. One of the reasons it occurs is when an AI system is trained using partial or insufficient data. The system works well when asked to solve problems using the ‘training’ data but poorly when exposed to previously unseen data.  
- must consider the volume and breadth of data
- While programming AI, you use data that you label and computer algorithms will match the data to the labels. This will create a model, which you can then use with new data to infer the labels.

**Applications of AI: Computer Vision**
- computer stores images as pixels and they identify features from the images

- they search for *feature* using a *filter* (image processing)

- *filter* will form the basis of your models to map *input* into *output*

- During the training process, the application learns the best filters that change images such that the features that differentiate healthy and diseased retinas emerge. Once the application has a set of filters that consistently change input images to healthy or diseased images, it can use these filters to diagnose previously unseen retinal images.

- Images are stored in a computer as pixel values. A grid of numbers can represent a grayscale image, with each cell in the grid representing a pixel value between 0 and 255. Filters can be applied to this image to extract vertical edges or lines.

- Filters are smaller grids of numbers (in this case, a 3x3 grid). A filter is applied sequentially to 3x3 sections of the image grid. When a filter is applied, each value on the image grid is multiplied by the corresponding value on the filter. All the nine resulting values are summed up, and the resulting sum is the final value of one pixel in the filtered image. In this particular case, the initial 6x6 image results in a smaller image. This specific filter helps extract vertical edges. Note that the filtered image is easier to work with since it is smaller but has not lost any essential features. On the other hand, certain features are enhanced and help in recognizing image content!

**From Data to Training Post**
- the better your data is, the better the model will be, the higher the intelligence of your model

**Other AI Applications**
**AI Frameworks**
1. Gather Data
2. Label Data
3. Create a Model

- AI uses hidden patterns to achieve the objective (presumably in binary digits)
- Activity recognition
- Games
- Natural Language Processings

> Eventually AI is matching what is perceived to labels through models built
